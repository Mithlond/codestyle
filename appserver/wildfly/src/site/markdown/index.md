# About mithlond-codestyle-appserver-wildfly-reactor

The Appserver Wildfly reactor contains all assembly projects 
which create overlays for the
[Wildfly application server](http://wildfly.org/), separated by their version numbers.

While the overlay works well with both WildFly versions 9 and 10,
the latest version is recommended to enjoy the latest suite of bugfixes,
performance enhancements and compatibility with the IDM ("Identity Managent")
system, [Keycloak](http://keycloak.jboss.org).
