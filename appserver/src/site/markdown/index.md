# About mithlond-codestyle-appserver-reactor

Getting the basic infrastructure ready for running on an application server
can be a daunting task, with great potential for incorrect configuration.
The overlays produced by modules to this reactor POM are meant to be unpacked in 
(the root of) a vanilla application installation to create a fully
operating application server in a matter of seconds.
