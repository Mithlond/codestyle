# About mithlond-codestyle-api-parent

The API parent should be used as the parent POM of all API (or SPI) artifact projects.
In addition to providing all facilities included in the mithlond-codestyle-parent, the 
mithlond-codestyle-api-parent generates a JAR manifest which contains export statements 
for all packages within the project. Such a manifest assists in accessing classes and 
resources from within the JAR if executing within a classloader-restricted runtime 
environment such as OSGi.
